# Can Grim Reapers prove the *per se* causal-regress premise?

**Target:** `STMT-NO-INFINITE-PER-SE-EFFICIENT-CAUSE-SERIES`, the still-open
Second Way claim interpreted as well-foundedness of `CausesAsCaused`. The current
corpus has a sourced reading but no independent proof of this claim. The result
`AQUINAS-ST-I-Q2-A3-SECUNDA-VIA` uses it as a premise; it does **not** establish
it. Likewise, an infinite chain of temporal causes *per accidens* is not the
same claim as an essentially ordered chain exercising power *per se*.

## 1. The no-first-deadline Grim Reaper test

Consider Reapers with deadlines indexed by `Nat`; a higher index signifies an
earlier deadline. There is no earliest deadline. Give each Reaper the rule:

> Reaper `n` acts **if and only if** no Reaper with a higher index acts.

Formally, `acts n ↔ ∀ m > n, ¬ acts m`.

The axiom-free Lean result
`GRIM-REAPER-NO-FIRST-SCHEDULE-IMPOSSIBLE` derives a contradiction:

1. If some Reaper `n` acts, no higher-index Reaper acts.
2. In particular, none higher than `n + 1` acts. The rule then **requires**
   `n + 1` to act, contradicting (1).
3. So no Reaper acts. The rule for index `0` then requires Reaper `0` to act,
   again contradicting the supposition.

This is an inconsistency of **that combined schedule and rule**, not of an
infinite ordered set alone. The companion model
`FINITE-GRIM-REAPER-SCHEDULE-CONSISTENT` verifies that three Reapers with the
same rule are consistent: the maximum-index (earliest-deadline) Reaper acts.

The law already captures the strong assumption that there is an action at a
deadline exactly when none has occurred earlier. A physical story adds more
assumptions: a victim initially alive, each Reaper capable of acting, no
unrelated death or resurrection invalidating that equivalence, and the
specified deadlines and counterfactuals being jointly realizable. Dropping or
weakening these assumptions may dissolve the contradiction.

## 2. Why this does not yet establish the target

The per se premise in Aquinas, *Summa theologiae* I q.2 a.3, concerns the
simultaneous dependence of an intermediate efficient cause on another. A
Grim Reaper sequence, by contrast, is a supertask-style arrangement of
events ordered **in time**, with a specialized inhibition rule. Neither the
temporal order nor its action rule follows from the definition of `CausesAsCaused`.

`INFINITE-LOCAL-TRANSMISSION-MODEL` makes the underdetermination explicit:

- There is a predecessor relation `R (n + 1) n` with no first member.
- All nodes are currently active, so each satisfies the **local** condition
  `active n ↔ active (n + 1)`.
- Nevertheless `R` is not well-founded (`¬ Acc R 0`).

This is a consistent mathematical model. It is **not** a demonstrated possible
world containing genuinely derivative efficient causes. In particular, a
defender may insist that "causing only as caused" imposes more than matching
activity: a power must actually be *grounded*, not just locally correlated.
But that stronger meaning must be specified and independently defended.

The exact missing step is a **transfer principle** of roughly this form:

> If a genuinely *per se* cause-chain had no first, its powers and dependencies
> could be arranged into a jointly possible Reaper-type configuration with the
> stated action rule.

This is related to a causal-network *patchwork* or recombination principle.
It is not pure logic. Merely assuming "no first entails no effect" as the
transfer principle would restate the desired conclusion and beg the question.
Formalizing a conditional proof from an explicitly assumed transfer principle
is straightforward, but would close no frontier premise until that principle
itself is justified. No such axiom is included in these verified results.

## 3. The deeper issue: which notion of grounding?

An equation at every link, `power(n) = power(n + 1)`, for binary power has two uniform
solutions (every link powerless or every link powered). If "powered" is instead
defined **inductively**, so that only finitely grounded chains of power count,
then a chain with no base does not acquire power. Both mathematical approaches
are internally coherent. The choice of inductive (rather than coinductive or
global) grounding semantics is **a philosophical premise**, not a theorem
about natural numbers or about the Reapers.

This suggests a sharper proof task than "all infinities are impossible":

1. Define a *per se* instrumental cause by its **essentially borrowed** power,
   not merely its temporal ancestry or observed activity.
2. Show, without encoding a first cause into that definition, that an entire
   infinite chain of such borrowings cannot ground even one present causal act.
3. Challenge that argument with a global/coinductive model; explain why its
   power should not count as a genuinely derivative causal power, or concede
   the limit of the proof.
4. Only then, if helpful, defend a bridge from a hypothetical chain to a
   *possible* Grim Reaper configuration. Distinguish logically consistent
   instructions, physically possible operations, and metaphysically possible
   causal networks; a paradox in the instructions by itself does not settle
   these modalities.

## 4. Primary-source boundary and further objections

- **Pinned:** Aquinas, *Summa theologiae* I q.2 a.3, via
  `AQUINAS-ST-I-Q2-A3`, argues that removing the first cause removes the
  middle and the last; this is the very inference under challenge.
- **New pinned witness:** Aristotle, *Metaphysics* II.2 (994a),
  `ARIST-MET-II-2`, from the existing immutable Perseus Greek snapshot. Aristotle
  says that all terms of an infinite series of this kind would be intermediate
  and without a first there is no cause. The chapter treats several kinds of
  cause, so applying that statement specifically to the typed relation
  `CausesAsCaused` requires an interpretive step. The passage is **not** counted
  as a mathematical proof of well-foundedness.
- **Research leads, not yet pinned claims:** Robert Koons, *A New Kalam
  Argument: Revenge of the Grim Reaper* (the causal-network patchwork route);
  Nicholas Shackel, *The Form of the Benardete Dichotomy* (the unsatisfiable-pair
  diagnosis); Alexander Pruss, *Infinity, Causation, and Paradox* (super-tasks
  and causal finitism), and his 2025 essay *Grim Reapers and Logical
  Impossibility* (the effects of additional rules such as resurrection);
  Schmid and Malpass, *Benardete Paradoxes, Causal Finitism, and the
  Unsatisfiable Pair Diagnosis* (objections and replies).

**Frontier verdict:** the impossible Reaper schedule is constructively proved;
the finite schedule and infinite local-transmission countermodel are proved.
`STMT-NO-INFINITE-PER-SE-EFFICIENT-CAUSE-SERIES` remains **open**. The next
research slice is an independent defense of grounding/transfer, with strong
countermodels, not a Lean `sorry` removed by restating the target as an axiom.
